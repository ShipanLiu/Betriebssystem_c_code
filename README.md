User Guide:

01-all folders that starts with "z" have nothing to do with the russian army but just means they belong to the WS22/23, same as all the folders start with "u" means they belong to SS2022

02-the Wiederholung Klausur is way much easier than then first Klausur.

03-in the exercise, they will provide you a mock or old exam and explain that to you in about the last 2 exercises during the semester. So be serious about this mock/old exam. Because in the Klausur, the programming part will be exactly as the type in the mock/old exam.
