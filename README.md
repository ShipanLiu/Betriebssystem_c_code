this repo records the exercises in SS2022 and WS22/23(wiederholungssemester) of Betriebsystem in the RUB. if you follow the exercises, you will pass the exam.

if you feel upset or worried before the final exam, please give me a star for this github repo, I will use the traditional mysterious and powerful chinese spell to bless you, so that you will pass the exam as me.

User Guide:

01-all folders that start with "z" have nothing to do with the russian army but just means they belong to the WS22/23, same as all the folders start with "u" means they belong to SS2022

02-the Wiederholung Klausur is way much easier than then first Klausur.

03-in the exercise, they will provide you a mock or old exam and explain that to you in about the last 2 exercises during the semester. So be serious about this mock/old exam. Because in the Klausur, the programming part will be exactly as the type in the mock/old exam. So you don't have to worry about the programming part(if you have learned seriously during the semester), the theory part(50%) are mostly all from the old exams, I repeat again, all!!!

04-live examples: if you know nothing about the programming part(the Makefile is an exception, if you don't even know how to write a Makefile at the end of the semester, I suggest you to click this link https://reurl.cc/LNn3r7), you can still pass the exam, a friend of mine has passed the exam with 3,7.
